# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:

- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application

The CLI asks the user for zip code input, then shows a list of available dogs. The CLI next asks the user to select a dog to view more information about.
The user can then type list or exit. If the user types something else they get an error message.

- [x] Pull data from an external source

Adoptable dog data is pulled from <https://www.petsmartcharities.org/>

- [x] Implement both list and detail views

The Ruby Gem shows a list of available dogs and then allows users to view more details about an individual dog.
